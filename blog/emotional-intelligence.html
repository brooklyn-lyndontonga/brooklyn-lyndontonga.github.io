        I find making friends a neutral space. I would consider myself friendly and will greet people with welcoming politeness, but i find it hard to connect on a deeper level.
        At times my friendships sometimes feel superficial, being an adult i find it even harder to make deeper connections with people i consider my friends because of how busy our individual lives are.
        I am mindful of this and you may notice as i develop in this space that i may share things as a way to relate to my blog readers on a more personal level.
        However, I am excited to use the new knowledge about emotional intelligence to develop as a great human.
