      <p>Aditonal to the brief outline in our handbook, I found the video below a helpful resource to help me 
        understand the importance of Emotional Intelligence in the workplace.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Here are some of the things that stood out to me from this video.</h3>
      <h2 class="h2">"Being Intelligent about emotions!!"</h2>
      <p>
        Daniel Goleman highlights the importance of balancing cognitive intelligence with emotional intelligence to achieve well-rounded success and fulfillment in life.

      <h2 class="h2">Knowing Yourself.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Being calm and being able to relax when you are upset.</li>
        <li>Going with the flow and being okay with change.</li>
        <li>Feeling confident and believing in yourself!!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h2">Controlling Yourself.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding your feelings, when you're happy, sad, angry, or stressed.</li>
        <li>Knowing your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
        <li>Being resilient and not letting problems get you down for too long.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h2">Understanding Others.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Putting yourself in their shoes and being mindful of how others feel.</li>
        <li>Reading people by understanding what people may be thinking by their body language - reading the room.</li>
        <li>Helping others by being a support for your friends and whanau.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">Getting Along.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Inspiring others by motivating people to do their best.</li>
        <li>Talking things out and communicating clearly and listening to others.</li>
        <li>Fixing problems by solving disagreements peacefully.</li>
        <li>Making friends by building good relationships.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I find making friends a neutral space. I would consider myself friendly and will greet people with welcoming politeness, but I find it hard to connect on a deeper level.
        At times my friendships sometimes feel superficial; being an adult, I find it even harder to make deeper connections with people I consider my friends because of how busy our individual lives are.
        I am mindful of this and you may notice as I develop in this space that I may share things as a way to relate to my blog readers on a more personal level.
        However, I am excited to use the new knowledge about emotional intelligence to develop as a great human.
