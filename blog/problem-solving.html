        <h1>Problem Solving:</h1>
        <p>Problem solving is a crucial skill for any developer. It involves breaking down complex problems
        into smaller, manageable parts, and then finding a solution to each part. This skill is essential
        for any developer, as it allows them to tackle complex problems and create efficient solutions.

        <h2>When Solving a Simple Problem:</h2>
        <p>There were times where I over complicated things throughout this sprint and 
          would get caught up on the return/results and lose track of the simple things that were pulling me up.
        </p>
        <p>When these issues came up I found the Rubber Ducky method to be quite beneficial, or some variation of the method.
          I would talk to myself internally instead of talking to inanimate objects - as to not look like I've lost my marbles.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout the process I had to remind myself that i dont know alot of what there is to know 
          and to give myself grace and that it is okay to ask for help or take a break.
        </p>
        <p>There was more personal development and learning done this week than technical learning but also in that, 
          I think my efforts deserve some credit.

        <h2>Elegeant Problem Solving:</h2>
        <p>Like I’ve said before I tend to over complicate things and this week to 
          solve that particular issue I was able to apply the problem solving technique “Pseudocoding”.
        </p>
        <p>By sectioning off each expectation or goal into its own space, 
          I was able to break each problem into its own little category with cascading actions below to solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>Also considering that I am somewhat of a dummy and find it hard to retain new knowledge, 
          I found this method extremely beneficial in the sense that within each list of actions I was able to include 
          the necessary research to learn what and how each action can solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this experience and with this new tool I am able to structure my workload better and as a result, solve problems faster.
          </p>

        <h2>Reflections: Problem Solving:</h2>
        <p>
          After a good amount of research on the suggested problem solving methods I am confident in my ability to practice the methods adequately. 
          I have become quite fond of the Pseudocode method and pairing that with Google to access good sources of information 
          I was able to accomplish the exercises in a good time, while strengthening the neuroplasticity towards web development.
        </p>
        <p>'In this sprint particularly, I knew I had fallen quite far behind and was very reluctant to reach out, 
          especially when going through the Discord and seeing everyone ask questions that did not apply to what I was currently working on 
          because I was so far behind. However, with some self-reflecting and some self-reasoning I was able to pull myself out of my head and 
          first reach out to friends for reassurance and then to facilitators who were also a source of reassurance as well as being technical support. 
          In hindsight, being able to refer back to my peers' queries in the Discord was a gift in the sense that I was able to avoid those issues before they happened without having to ask myself.
