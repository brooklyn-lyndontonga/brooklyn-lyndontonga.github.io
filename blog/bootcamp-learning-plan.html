  <h2 class="h2">Learning and Wellbeing Plan</h2>
  <p class="p">Weekly: Set Time for Independent Learning
Goal: Have time to explore on my own.
Plan:
Pick 30 minutes each day to work on something you choose (like a fun coding challenge or a topic you’re curious about).
Keep distractions away during this time, using a timer or app if needed.
At the end of the week, think about how it felt to have this space to yourself.
</p>
<p class="p">Monthly: Plan a Flexible Learning Day
Goal: Have a full day of self-directed learning on personal projects.
Plan:
Choose a day when your schedule is lighter.
Create your own mini-project using what you’ve learned so far. It could be a fun website or a small app—something that excites you.
Set your own goals and deadlines for the day, and then see how much you accomplish.
Reflect on the experience at the end of the day.
