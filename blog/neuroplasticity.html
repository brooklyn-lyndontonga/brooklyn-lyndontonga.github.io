      <h3> Neuroplasticity:</h3>
        <p>
          When I think of the Brain, I think of it as a muscle and when you work on a muscle it gets stronger.
          And my research supports this idea  when you consider that neuroplasticity allows the brain to form and reorganize neural pathways and connections. 
          This process makes learning permanent through repeated practice to strengthen the pathways with information and skills, further ingraining them into your brain.
        </p>
      <h3>Understanding the Principles of Neuroplasticity:</h3>
        <p>
          Knowing about neuroplasticity helps you realize that your brain can change and improve.
          This is important for learning new things and recovering from challenges.
          By focusing on certain activities, you can make your brain healthier and better at learning.
        </p>
      <h3> Engaging with Neuroplasticity for Personal Benefit: </h3>
        <p>
          To take advantage of neuroplasticity, practice new skills regularly and keep challenging your brain. 
          Doing this makes it easier to learn and remember things. 
          A healthy lifestyle also supports your brain’s ability to adapt and grow.
        </p>
      <h3>Increasing Neuroplasticity:</h3>
        <p>
          You can boost neuroplasticity by learning new things, exercising, meditating, and getting enough sleep.
          These activities help your brain stay flexible and strong. 
          The more you challenge your brain, the better it gets at adapting

      <h3>Growth Mindset:</h3>
        <p>
          After watching the ted talk by Carol Dweck and some faves from Youtube of The Comfrot Challenge by Tim Ferris, 
          reinforced many of the growth mindset beliefs I have and was a reminder of its value and importance in self-development. 
          Here are some of the things i learnt:
        </p>
      <h3> What is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is the belief that you can get smarter and better through effort and learning from mistakes. 
          Unlike a fixed mindset, it doesn’t see talent as something you're just born with.
          This mindset helps you stay motivated and open to new challenges.
        </p>
      <h3>The Importance of Growth Mindset:</h3>
        <p>
          Having a growth mindset makes you more likely to take on challenges and keep going when things get tough.
          It leads to better learning outcomes because you believe you can improve with effort.
          This mindset helps you stay positive and determined.
        </p>
      <h3>Insights and Personal Reflection:</h3>
        <p>
          It’s surprising how much better people do when they know about neuroplasticity and growth mindset. 
          This has made me realize that I can get better at things by putting in the effort.
          It’s encouraging to know that hard work and consistency really does pay off.
        </p>
      <h3>Integrating Growth Mindset into My Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I plan to use a growth mindset by taking on challenges and seeing mistakes as learning opportunities.
          I’ll remind myself that I can improve with practice and effort.
          This will keep me motivated and ready to learn.

      <h3>Developing my Learning Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
          I can develop my learning approach by focusing on consistent practice of new things, little by little to reshape and strengthen my brain into an efficient code brain.
          I can also use spaced repetition to help solidify new information in my long-term memory.
          I can adopt a growth mindset when I continue to take small learning steps, reflect on my progress, embrace my failures and view them instead as opportunities to learn.
