        Neuroplasticity:
      </h3>
      <p>
        When I think of the Brain, I think of it as a muscle and when you work on a muscle it gets stronger.
        And my research supports this idea  when you consider that neuroplasticity allows the brain to form and reorganize neural pathways and connections. 
        This process makes learning permanent through repeated practice to strengthen the pathways with information and skills, further ingraining them into your brain.

      <h3>
        Understanding the Principles of Neuroplasticity:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Knowing about neuroplasticity helps you realize that your brain can change and improve.
        This is important for learning new things and recovering from challenges.
        By focusing on certain activities, you can make your brain healthier and better at learning.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Engaging with Neuroplasticity for Personal Benefit:
      </h3>
      <p>
        To take advantage of neuroplasticity, practice new skills regularly and keep challenging your brain. 
        Doing this makes it easier to learn and remember things. 
        A healthy lifestyle also supports your brainâ€™s ability to adapt and grow.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Increasing Neuroplasticity:
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can boost neuroplasticity by learning new things, exercising, meditating, and getting enough sleep.
        These activities help your brain stay flexible and strong. 
        The more you challenge your brain, the better it gets at adapting

        Growth Mindset:
      </h3>
      <p>
        After watching the ted talk by Carol Dweck and some faves from Youtube of The Comfrot Challenge by Tim Ferris, 
        reinforced many of the growth mindset beliefs I have and was a reminder of its value and importance in self-development. 
        Here are some of the things i learnt:
