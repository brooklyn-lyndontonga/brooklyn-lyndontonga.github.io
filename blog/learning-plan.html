      <h3>
        My long term career goal is to govern my own time while still being able to provide financial support for my whanau.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Dev Academy with help me achieve that by teaching me practical skills that I can to find remote work in web development.

        Limitations:
        </h2>
        

        <h3>
        Frustration with Non-Conformity:
        </h3> 

          <p>
          It can be frustrating for me when others do not follow my preferred methods. 
          This frustration is often internalized, which may lead to stress or dissatisfaction.
          </p>

        <h3>
        Analytical Over-Reliance:
        </h3>

          <p>
          While my emphasis on analyzing facts before making decisions is a strength, it can also lead to "analysis-paralysis,"
          where i may delay decisions while waiting for more information, potentially hindering timely action.
          </p>

        <h3>
        Potential Rigidity:
        </h3>

          <p>
          A strict adherence to procedures and expectations might limit flexibility and adaptability, 
          which can be challenging in dynamic or rapidly changing situations.
          </p>

  <div class="pink-background space">
      <h2>3 skills i want to imporve:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li> Emotional Intelligence:</li>
    <li> Adaptability:</li>
    <li> Decision Making:</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This might looking like 
    1. working on my self-awareness and self-regulating. 
    2. being flexible and problem solve. 
    3. Better prioritizing and decisiveness.

  <h2>
    Workload Management:
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    To improve my workload management i intend to implement and practice these things:
  </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Organisational Systems: such as task manager apps like trello, digital calendar to stay updated with tasks, and have a dedicated spasce for any work in Google Docs.</li>
    <li> Managing Deadlines: by setting deadlines for tasks, prioritizing tasks using Eisenhower Matrix, and conducting regular reviews.</li>
    <li> Efficient Collaborating: using communication tools such as slack, scheduling regular check-ins with team.</li>
    <li> Trackiong Progress: creating a project dashboard to monitor progress, prepare and share progress reports, collect andd incorporate feedback from team.</li>
    <li> Time Management: Implement time blocking and continue using Pomodoro method to ensure quality work and good breaks.</li>
    <li> Review and Adapt: Periodically evaluate my organisational methods and adjust my strategies based on feedback and what is needed.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>


<div class="green-background space">
  <h2>
    What facillitators can do to help me succeed:
  </h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li> Give clear instructions: Explain course goals, deadlines, and assignments clearly.</li>
    <li> Offer support: Be available for help and provide useful materials.</li>
    <li> Engage and motivate: Use interactive teaching methods and be encouraging.</li>
    <li> Share expertise: Offer expert knowledge and real-world insights.</li>
    <li> Foster a positive learning environment: Create a respectful and inclusive atmosphere.</li>
    <li> Assist with problme solving: Help with technical issues and offer advice.</li>
    <li> Maintain transparency: Clearly explain grading and any changes to the course and offer honest feedback about my progress.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is apparent to me that many of the expectations i have of my facillitator are already 
    being met which speaks volumes to the competencies they have.
    KEEP BEING AWESOME!!!

  <h2>
    My Schedule:
  </h2>

  <h3>
  Here is a  breakdown of how a typical day for me should look:
  </h3>
  
  <ul style >
    <li>9:00 to 9:30 - Morning School Run.</li>
    <li>9:30 to 2:00 - Studies.</li>
    <li>2:00 to 3:00 - Gym.</li>
    <li>3:00 to 4:00 - Afternoon School Run.</li>
    <li>4:00 to 5:00 - Study.</li>
    <li>5:00 to 8:00 - Family Time.</li>  
    <li>8:00 to 10:00 - Study.</li>
    <li>10:00 onwards I am Sleeping.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    That gives me about 8 hours of study time, 4 and a half hours family time, and 1 hour to go to the gym.
  </p>

  <p>
    The commitments i have outside of Dev Academy that may have an affect on my participation is my young children 
      and the ability to make it to Haututu Hacklab in Gisborne (it is a 30-45 minute commute).
