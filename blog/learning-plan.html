      <h1>UPDATED Learning Plan:</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        I hope that with the skills I acquire from Dev academy I can land work where I can use these skills.
        Preferably remote work that I can carry out around the demands of my family life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strengths that I will call on during bootcamp will consist of my ability to absorb information, 
        paired with my willingness to learn new things. As well as the strengths identified in foundations 
        I look forward to adding more to my list of strengths and capabilities.

        My biggest limitations will be time. 
        Managing my family is a priority and although I have my partner who can help support me, 
        he is also our household's main source of income and having him take time off means he will have to take time off work. 
        Although I am mindful of the limitations I have mentioned during foundations I am slowly working on 
        overcoming each inability and look forward to seeing my developments in actions during bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenges will be staying focused,
        communicating efficiently with peers, and staying on top of the workload.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would be very pleased with myself if I am able to come out of Dev Academy having overcome my self-doubting,
        imposter syndrome that often comes to the surface when things are difficult.
        I tend to overthink and become anxious and will often add fuel to the fire but if I can overcome these things
        I would be very proud of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Support to me looks like my inner circle. 
        Mainly consisting of my partner and the people closest to us. 
        I am also fortunate to have the support of the team at Taiki E! and Haututu Hacklab 
        where I have a friend in my cohort and friends who are Dev Academy graduates who are 
        great sources of technical and non-technical support.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am committed to seeing this through to the end with my best efforts. 
        I am constantly reviewing my timetable and looking for ways to use my time efficiently and get the most out of my time. 
        I plan to be on program during the operating hours of the Haututu Hacklab which will 
        allow me the ability to meet the expectations of the part-time bootcamp.
      </p>

      <h3>
        My long term career goal is to govern my own time while still being able to provide financial support for my whanau.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Dev Academy will help me achieve that by teaching me practical skills that I can use to find remote work in web development.
      </p>

      <h3> 
        According to VIA Character analysis these are my top 5 strengths:
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. Gratitude<br>
        2. Curiosity<br>
        3. Love of learning<br>
        4. Prudence<br>
        5. Judgement.

    </div>

    <div class="yellow-background">
      <h2>Limitations:</h2>
      <h3>Frustration with Non-Conformity:</h3>
      <p>
        It can be frustrating for me when others do not follow my preferred methods. 
        This frustration is often internalized, which may lead to stress or dissatisfaction.
      </p>
      <h3>Analytical Over-Reliance:</h3>
      <p>
        While my emphasis on analyzing facts before making decisions is a strength, it can also lead to "analysis-paralysis,"
        where I may delay decisions while waiting for more information, potentially hindering timely action.
      </p>
      <h3>Potential Rigidity:</h3>
      <p>
        A strict adherence to procedures and expectations might limit flexibility and adaptability, 
        which can be challenging in dynamic or rapidly changing situations.
      </p>
    </div>  
  
    <div class="pink-background">
      <h2>3 skills I want to improve:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional Intelligence</li>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Decision Making</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This might look like 
        1. working on my self-awareness and self-regulating.<br>
        2. being flexible and problem-solving.<br>
        3. better prioritizing and decisiveness.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-background">
      <h2>Workload Management:</h2>
      <h3>
        To improve my workload management, I intend to implement and practice these things:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizational Systems: such as task manager apps like Trello, digital calendar to stay updated with tasks, and have a dedicated space for any work in Google Docs.</li>
        <li>Managing Deadlines: by setting deadlines for tasks, prioritizing tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, and conducting regular reviews.</li>
        <li>Efficient Collaborating: using communication tools such as Slack, scheduling regular check-ins with the team.</li>
        <li>Tracking Progress: creating a project dashboard to monitor progress, prepare and share progress reports, collect and incorporate feedback from the team.</li>
        <li>Time Management: Implement time blocking and continue using the Pomodoro method to ensure quality work and good breaks.</li>
        <li>Review and Adapt: Periodically evaluate my organizational methods and adjust my strategies based on feedback and what is needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="green-background">
      <h2>What facilitators can do to help me succeed:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Give clear instructions: Explain course goals, deadlines, and assignments clearly.</li>
        <li>Offer support: Be available for help and provide useful materials.</li>
        <li>Engage and motivate: Use interactive teaching methods and be encouraging.</li>
        <li>Share expertise: Offer expert knowledge and real-world insights.</li>
        <li>Foster a positive learning environment: Create a respectful and inclusive atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Assist with problem-solving: Help with technical issues and offer advice.</li>
        <li>Maintain transparency: Clearly explain grading and any changes to the course and offer honest feedback about my progress.</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>
        It is apparent to me that many of the expectations I have of my facilitator are already 
        being met which speaks volumes to the competencies they have.
        KEEP BEING AWESOME!!!
      </p>

    <div class="pink-background">
      <h2>My Schedule:</h2>
      <h3>Here is a breakdown of how a typical day for me should look:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>9:00 to 9:30 - Morning School Run.</li>
        <li>9:30 to 2:00 - Studies.</li>
        <li>2:00 to 3:00 - Gym.</li>
        <li>3:00 to 4:00 - Afternoon School Run.</li>
        <li>4:00 to 5:00 - Study.</li>
        <li>5:00 to 8:00 - Family Time.</li>  
        <li>8:00 to 10:00 - Study.</li>
        <li>10:00 onwards - Sleeping.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="green-background">
      <p>
        That gives me about 8 hours of study time, 4 and a half hours of family time, and 1 hour to go to the gym.
      </p>
      <p>
        The commitments I have outside of Dev Academy that may affect my participation include my young children 
        and the ability to make it to Haututu Hacklab in Gisborne (it is a 30-45 minute commute).
