      </div>
        
      <div class="red-background">
        <h3 class="h3">
          My long term career goal is to govern my own time while still being able to provide financial support for my whanau.
        </h3>
        <p class="p">
          Dev Academy will help me achieve that by teaching me practical skills that I can use to find remote work in web development.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pink-background">
        <h3 class="h3"> 
          According to VIA Character analysis these are my top 5 strengths:
        </h3>
        <p class="p">
          1. Gratitude<br>
          2. Curiosity<br>
          3. Love of learning<br>
          4. Prudence<br>
          5. Judgement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="yellow-background">
        <h2 class="h2">Limitations:</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">Frustration with Non-Conformity:</h3>
        <p class="p">
          It can be frustrating for me when others do not follow my preferred methods. 
          This frustration is often internalized, which may lead to stress or dissatisfaction.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">Analytical Over-Reliance:</h3>
        <p class="p">
          While my emphasis on analyzing facts before making decisions is a strength, it can also lead to "analysis-paralysis,"
          where I may delay decisions while waiting for more information, potentially hindering timely action.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">Potential Rigidity:</h3>
        <p class="p">
          A strict adherence to procedures and expectations might limit flexibility and adaptability, 
          which can be challenging in dynamic or rapidly changing situations.
        </p>
      </div>  
    
      <div class="pink-background">
        <h2 class="h2">3 skills I want to improve:</h2>
        <ul class="p">
          <li>Emotional Intelligence</li>
          <li>Adaptability</li>
          <li>Decision Making</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
          This might look like: <br>
          1. working on my self-awareness and self-regulation.<br>
          2. being flexible and problem-solving.<br>
          3. better prioritizing and decisiveness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="red-background">
        <h2 class="h2">Workload Management:</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">
          To improve my workload management, I intend to implement and practice these things:
        </h3>
        <ul class="p">
          <li>Organizational Systems: such as task manager apps like Trello, digital calendar to stay updated with tasks, and have a dedicated space for any work in Google Docs.</li>
          <li>Managing Deadlines: by setting deadlines for tasks, prioritizing tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, and conducting regular reviews.</li>
          <li>Efficient Collaborating: using communication tools such as Slack, scheduling regular check-ins with the team.</li>
          <li>Tracking Progress: creating a project dashboard to monitor progress, prepare and share progress reports, collect and incorporate feedback from the team.</li>
          <li>Time Management: Implement time blocking and continue using the Pomodoro method to ensure quality work and good breaks.</li>
          <li>Review and Adapt: Periodically evaluate my organizational methods and adjust my strategies based on feedback and what is needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="green-background">
        <h2 class="h2">What facilitators can do to help me succeed:</h2>
        <ul class="p">
          <li>Give clear instructions: Explain course goals, deadlines, and assignments clearly.</li>
          <li>Offer support: Be available for help and provide useful materials.</li>
          <li>Engage and motivate: Use interactive teaching methods and be encouraging.</li>
          <li>Share expertise: Offer expert knowledge and real-world insights.</li>
          <li>Foster a positive learning environment: Create a respectful and inclusive atmosphere.</li>
          <li>Assist with problem-solving: Help with technical issues and offer advice.</li>
          <li>Maintain transparency: Clearly explain grading and any changes to the course and offer honest feedback about my progress.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p class="p">
          It is apparent to me that many of the expectations I have of my facilitator are already 
          being met which speaks volumes to the competencies they have.
          KEEP BEING AWESOME!!!
        </p>

      <div class="pink-background">
        <h2 class="h2">My Schedule:</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">Here is a breakdown of how a typical day for me should look:</h3>
        <ul class="p">
          <li>9:00 to 9:30 - Morning School Run.</li>
          <li>9:30 to 2:00 - Studies.</li>
          <li>2:00 to 3:00 - Gym.</li>
          <li>3:00 to 4:00 - Afternoon School Run.</li>
          <li>4:00 to 5:00 - Study.</li>
          <li>5:00 to 8:00 - Family Time.</li>  
          <li>8:00 to 10:00 - Study.</li>
          <li>10:00 onwards - Sleeping.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="green-background">
        <p class="p">
          That gives me about 8 hours of study time, 4 and a half hours of family time, and 1 hour to go to the gym.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          The commitments I have outside of Dev Academy that may affect my participation include my young children 
          and the ability to make it to Haututu Hacklab in Gisborne (it is a 30-45 minute commute).
