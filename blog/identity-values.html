      <p>
        Much like the questions asked in a job interview we are asked a series of questions to help ourselves better understand and identify the values that drive us.
        Theses were some of those questions and my response.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li>
          <li> 2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
          <li> 3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
          <li> 4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
          <li> 5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="green-background">
      <p>In my previous job, I faced an ethical dilemma between my career and my family. 
        Due to demanding work hours, I struggled to balance professional responsibilities with my role as a parent. 
        After weighing the importance of my children’s formative years against financial stability, I chose to prioritize my family. 
        I feel confident in this decision, though I now realize I could have better prepared for the transition to ease financial strain.</p>

        <p>My culture and the people around me have significantly influenced my values and identity. 
          Ensuring the succession of my culture to my children is paramount. My parents, despite not having the same opportunities, ensured I attended kohanga and kura kaupapa, which rooted me in Maori culture. 
            My partner has been a constant source of support, and my children give me an extra reason to stay connected to my roots. 
            Receiving my moko kauae affirmed my commitment to my culture and my pride in being Maori. 
            My values and identity evolve with my whanau’s needs, aiming to be a living example for them.</p>

          <p>Empathy and stoicism are my top strengths. 
            Empathy helps me understand others' perspectives, while stoicism allows me to govern my choices positively. 
            These strengths will support me in my learning journey by helping me remain patient and mindful of others' challenges. 
            I believe being slower but mindful will benefit my studies and career, enabling thoughtful decision-making.</p>

            <p>I have experience minor resistance and tension in a team with conflicting personalities and a wide representation of generations. To manage this, I didn’t take things personally, which helped me stay calm and unoffended. In hindsight, standing up for myself and others could have improved understanding and communication within the team. In the future, 
              I plan to combine emotional management with proactive communication to create a more inclusive and productive team environment.</p>
