            I hope that with the skills I acquire from Dev Academy, I can land work where I can use these skills, 
            preferably remote work that I can carry out around the demands of my family life.

            Strengths that I will call on during Bootcamp will include my ability to absorb information, 
            paired with my willingness to learn new things. In addition to the strengths identified in Foundations, 
            I look forward to adding more to my list of strengths and capabilities.

            My biggest limitation will be time. Managing my family is a priority, and although I have 
            my partner who can help support me, he is also our household's main source of income, and having 
            him take time off means he will have to take time off work. Although I am mindful of the limitations 
            I mentioned during Foundations, I am slowly working on overcoming each challenge and look forward 
            to seeing my developments in action during Bootcamp.

            My biggest non-technical challenges will be staying focused, 
            communicating efficiently with peers, and staying on top of the workload.
          </p>

            I would be very pleased with myself if I am able to come out of Dev Academy having 
            overcome my self-doubt and imposter syndrome that often surfaces when things are difficult. 
            I tend to overthink and become anxious, which can exacerbate the situation, but if I can 
            overcome these challenges, I would be very proud of myself.

            Support to me looks like my inner circle, mainly consisting of my partner and the people closest to us. 
            I am also fortunate to have the support of the team at Taiki E! and Haututu Hacklab, where 
            I have a friend in my cohort and friends who are Dev Academy graduates. They are great sources 
            of technical and non-technical support.

            I am committed to seeing this through to the end with my best efforts. 
            I am constantly reviewing my timetable and looking for ways to use my time efficiently
            and get the most out of my time. I plan to be on program during the operating hours of the 
            Haututu Hacklab, which will allow me to meet the expectations of the part-time Bootcamp.
