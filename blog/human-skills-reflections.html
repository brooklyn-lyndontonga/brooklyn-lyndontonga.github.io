What surprised me the most about human skills learning is how relevant they are to most aspects 
of being human, being progressive and consistent in your thinking and being understanding. 
While looking back at what we've learnt I have noticed the new and developed human skills the 
more I am mindful of them and the more I apply them outside of Dev Academy. 
It is underrated growth that I think is still really important.
        </p>
          <p>
 then first three things that come to mind when i recall the things i learnt in foundatinos are as followed:
 1. There is still so much I need to learn but the little steps matter the most, 
 to which I am reminded of the quote by the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” . 
 2. When things don't work out, give yourself grace because nobody is expecting you to know
  it all right now - I often become flustered and frustrated when things don't go according to plan
  so its really reassuring when i am reminded of this. 
3. Problems are just opportunities to learn a new way to solve it - this is something I learnt when 
adopting a growth mindset. There is always room to grow.
        </p>
          <p>
My understanding of the roles values, empathy and self-awareness play in learning to program 
are much like a compass that guides decision making and sets the tone for meeting the requirements. 

Particularly values, these are the foundations of what I would base my decisions on. 
My values being family, culture, empathy, learning, stoicism, to name a few. 
These values ultimately guide my decision making in the sense that compromising any o
f these values would inhibit my ability to apply myself 100%. 

The role of empathy being one of the things I value, adds a sense of importance in the 
area of having empathy for others when there are gaps in relations. 
To me, practicing empathy can simply be seeing things from an opposite perspective as 
if it were myself and sincerely understanding the reasoning behind the point of 
view with the consideration that I won't know all of the details and it's not my job to 
know but I can still show kindness and genuine concern regardless of the circumstances.

Understanding myself and my own thoughts and feelings is a significant part of self-awareness 
and calling on the ability to recognize myself and how I am affected and affecting others 
is a skill in and of itself. I think it is fundamental to personal growth and 
emotional intelligence to be self-aware. Having self awareness can foster good relationships, 
self-accountability and consideration.

 I initially found it hard to fully embrace the learnings because I felt 
 that I needed to learn the technical skills ahead of the human skills. 
 I carried on working through each sprint and I started to realize the importance 
 of understanding these skills and could see the value in these skills when programming. 
 It's less so about knowing how to code and more about being a good teammate and human overall.
         
        </p>
          <p>
My interpretation of the importance of Human skills in an area built for technical 
skills are in the way graduates work with others, 
being part of the team and not simply being a member of the team. 
The difference is being embraced by the team and developing strong interpersonal 
relationships with your teammates over simply being on the same team as someone.          
        </p>
          <p>
Upon completion of all 5 sprints I can see the value in the time dedicated to 
learning human skills over technical skills. 
And I can say with confidence that the execution of foundations has been a 
series of well received lessons and personal developments. 
In my view, the bigger picture is that by the end of the program we will graduate with 
the skills to be able to fit in well with already established teams of web developers 
where our human skills will make it easier to navigate. In terms of the technical skills, 
although they are significant, the biggest concern is that we understand what the technical 
aspects of web development do and why.
